## üõ†Ô∏è How to Contribute

### 1. Report Bugs or Issues

* Open a **GitHub Issue** with:

  * a clear and concise title,
  * a description of the problem,
  * steps to reproduce,
  * and (if applicable) code snippets or screenshots.

### 2. Suggest Enhancements

* Use the ‚ÄúFeature request‚Äù label in Issues.
* Explain *why* the feature is useful and, if possible, link relevant literature or prior work.

### 3. Submit Code Contributions

* Fork the repository:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ybwerneck/Pinn-Torch.git
  cd Pinn-Torch
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  ```
* Implement your changes following the [Development Guidelines](#-development-guidelines).
* Commit and push your branch:

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add feature: short description"
  git push origin feature/your-feature-name
  ```
* Open a **Pull Request (PR)** on GitHub, describing your contribution and linking related Issues.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Setup

To set up a development environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ybwerneck/Pinn-Torch.git
cd Pinn-Torch
pip install -e .[dev]
```

If you prefer a clean installation without developer extras:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## üí° Development Guidelines

Please follow these guidelines to maintain code quality and readability:

### Code Style

* Follow **PEP8** conventions (`black` or `autopep8` formatters are recommended).
* Use **descriptive variable names** and **type hints** where appropriate.
* Comment equations, derivations, and assumptions ‚Äî this is crucial for reproducibility.

### Documentation

* Each public function or class should include a **docstring**:

  ```python
  def train_model(model, data, epochs):
      """
      Train a PINN model with the given dataset.
      
      Args:
          model (torch.nn.Module): Neural network to train.
          data (torch.Tensor): Input training data.
          epochs (int): Number of training epochs.
      Returns:
          dict: Training loss history.
      """
  ```
* If you add a new example notebook, place it in:

  ```
  examples/
  ```

  and document it at the top with the problem, equations, and boundary conditions used.

### Folder Structure

```

* Keep example notebooks (`examples/*.ipynb`) clean and runnable without external dependencies beyond those listed in `setup.py`.
